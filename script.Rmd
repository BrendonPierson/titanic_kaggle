This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
setwd("/Users/ashlynkaran/Desktop/Kaggle/titanic_kaggle")
library('caret')

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

#Neither of these seem to be dropping the columns we want. But I don't think that matters.

#This gives us a Title column and gets rid of the names at the same time. 
names(trainSubset)[names(trainSubset) == 'Name'] <- 'Title'
trainSubset$Title <- gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', trainSubset$Title)
trainSubset$Title <- factor(trainSubset$Title)

names(testSubset)[names(testSubset) == 'Name'] <- 'Title'

testSubset$Title[testSubset$Title == 'Ms']          <- 'Miss'
trainSubset$Title[trainSubset$Title == 'Mme']         <- 'Mrs' 
testSubset$Title[testSubset$Title == 'Mme']         <- 'Mrs'

Train model: logistic regression.
Why? Outcome is binary. 

```{r}
formulaAll <- Survived ~ Pclass + Title + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Cabin + Embarked
logisticModelAll <- glm(formulaAll, data=trainSubset, family="binomial")

summary(logisticModelAll)
```
Embarked has the highest p value so we will drop it from the model and use anova to compare the models.
``` {r}
formula8 <- Survived ~ Pclass + Title + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Cabin 
logisticModel8 <- glm(formula8, data=trainSubset, family="binomial")

anova(logisticModel8, logisticModelAll, test = "Chisq")

summary(logisticModel8)
```
There is no significant difference when we include embarked, so we'll leave it out. The next highest p values are within cabin, so we will take that out next.

```{r}
formula7 <- Survived ~ Pclass + Title + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare 
logisticModel7 <- glm(formula7, data=trainSubset, family="binomial")

anova(logisticModel7, logisticModel8, test = "Chisq")

summary(logisticModel7)
```
Cabin is also not significant. Now fare is the highest p value, taking out fare.
```{r}
formula6 <- Survived ~ Pclass + Title + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch 
logisticModel6 <- glm(formula6, data=trainSubset, family="binomial")

anova(logisticModel6, logisticModel7, test = "Chisq")

summary(logisticModel6)
```
Next taking out Parch. 
```{r}
formula5 <- Survived ~ Pclass + Title + Sex + Age + SibSp
logisticModel5 <- glm(formula5, data=trainSubset, family="binomial")

anova(logisticModel5, logisticModel6, test = "Chisq")

summary(logisticModel5)
```
Parch is barely not significant (p = .05122)! Next lowest is title. This might be correlated with sex? Not sure why sex is NA. Maybe too similar to title. 
```{r}
formula4S <- Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp
logisticModel4S <- glm(formula4S, data=trainSubset, family="binomial")

anova(logisticModel4S, logisticModel5, test = "Chisq")

summary(logisticModel4)
```
There is a significant difference taking out title. Does that happen for sex also?
```{r}

formula4T <- Survived ~ Pclass + Title + Age + SibSp
logisticModel4T <- glm(formula4T, data=trainSubset, family="binomial")

anova(logisticModel4T, logisticModel5, test = "Chisq")
anova(logisticModel4T, logisticModel4S, test = "Chisq")

summary(logisticModel4T)
```
I think what this is telling me is that there is no difference between the model with sex and the model with title and sex, but that the title model works better than the sex model. 
```{r}
formula3A <- Survived ~ Pclass + Title + SibSp
logisticModel3A <- glm(formula3A, data=trainSubset, family="binomial")

anova(logisticModel3A, logisticModel4T, test = "Chisq")

summary(logisticModel3A)

```
Everything else is significant, so model 4T wins?
```{r}

#This seems like it isn't working because solution is giving us numbers that are not 0 or 1. 
prediction <- predict(logisticModel4T, testSubset)
solution <- data.frame(PassengerID = testSubset$PassengerId, Survived = prediction)
write.csv(solution, file = 'rf_mod_Solution.csv', row.names = F)

solution

```

Train model: rpart
```{r}
set.seed(100)

#trainSubset <- full[,]

                   method="rpart2",
                   tuneLength = 10,
                   trControl = trainControl(method = "cv"),
                   na.action=na.exclude
)

plot(rpartTune)
```

/*```{r}

                                            Fare + Embarked + Title + Cabin,
                                            data = trainSubset)
